## About IceWare
<br>
<b>IceWare</b> is a roblox exploiting script hub that was founded around december 2022. 
It was a solo project at first but became a fun little project between me and a few friends of mine.
In its lifetime, iw has been executed a bit over 1.5M+ time, 
wich i never expected as this was just a troll project at first.<br><br><br>




## Supported Games
<br>
<strong>Please note that IceWare is not made for mobile, if your mobile executor doesnt support the script please do not complain as its not a problem on our end. </strong><br>

```lua
-- Car Dealership Tycoon (OUTDATED)
```
<br>
Other supported games were removed because they were either outdated or cause of technical issues, we will re-add those games sometime in the future.<br><br><br>



## Loadstring
<br>
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxtcapi/IceWare/main/loader.lua",true))() -- Please note this is the only official loadstring
```
<br><br><br>


## Key System
<b>IceWare</b> does not use a key system for the moment as our custom key system is <b>not</b> finished.
This section will get updated whenever we finish the website, a tutorial on how to pass it will be included.
