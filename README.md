## About IceWare

<b>IceWare</b> is a roblox exploiting script hub that was founded around december 2022. 
It was a solo project at first but became a fun little project between me and a few friends of mine.
In its lifetime, iw has been executed a bit over 1.5M+ time, 
wich i never expected as this was just a troll project at first.<br><br>




## Supported Games

<strong>Please note that IceWare is not made for mobile, if your mobile executor doesnt support the script please do not complain as its not a problem on our end. </strong>


```lua
-- Car Dealership Tycoon (OUTDATED)
```

Other supported games were removed because they were either outdated or cause of technical issues, we will re-add those games sometime in the future.
